# Data Structures Project
## About
In this repository you will find my source code for implementing several **data structures** in C++. This project was developed alongside my University Course called *"Data Structures"* that I attended during my second semester of studies **(February 2020 - May 2020) at Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (CSD AUTh)** and it was pretty successful if I can say myself! The project was co-developed with a fellow student of mine
